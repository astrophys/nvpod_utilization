## Abstract
While running a Nvidia Super/Base-POD, one would like to accumulate relevant plots / statistics to present to management and customers. 
These include job / node level cpu / gpu utilization. 
I'm fairly familiar with how to interact with the slurm accounting database and I'd like to learn how to use the Base View measurables database

## Dependencies
1. Slurm
2. Base Command Manager (v10.0) with associated Nvidia hardware
